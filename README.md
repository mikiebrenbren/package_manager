# package_manager
Coding challenge that I completed that mocks the behavior of what a package manager must do in order to build dependencies in a way such that there are no dependencies that are cyclic and dependencies are always built before the dependent libraries.  Made keeping test driven development in mind with test cases created in Spock.  


This is a gradle project with tests done in groovy and spock framework.  I enjoyed finishing this although I am sure this could be refined to be much better than how I currently have it.
